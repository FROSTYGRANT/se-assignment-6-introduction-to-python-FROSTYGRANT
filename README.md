e. Education: Python's clear syntax and readability make it a popular choice for teaching programming fundamentals and advanced concepts in universities and coding bootcamps.
f. Game Development: Python, especially with libraries like Pygame, is used for developing 2D games and prototyping game logic.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
=> Installing Python on Windows 11:
a. Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the latest version of Python for Windows (usually a stable release like Python 3.10.x).
Run the Installer:
b. Once downloaded, run the Python installer.
c. Check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation to make it easier to run Python from the command line.
d. Follow the prompts in the Python installer. Click "Install Now" to begin the installation process.
=> Verifying Python Installation:
a. Press Win + R to open the Run dialog, type cmd, and press Enter to open Command Prompt.
b. In the Command Prompt, type python --version or python -V.
c. Type python in the Command Prompt and press Enter. You should see the Python interpreter prompt (>>>), indicating Python is installed and functioning correctly.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
                                    print("Hello, World!")
a. The print() function in Python is used to output data to the console.
b. "Hello, World!" is a string literal in Python. Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed within either single quotes (') or double quotes (").


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
a. Integer (int) - Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
b. Float (float) - Represents floating-point numbers, which include decimal points or use an exponential, example, y = 3.14.
c. String (str) - Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes, example, name = "John".
d. Boolean (bool) - Represents truth values True or False, example, is_active = True
e. List (list) - Represents ordered collections of items, which can be of mixed data types, example, numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
f. Tuple (tuple) - Similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation), example, coordinates = (10, 20).
g. Dictionary (dict) - Represents key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}, example, person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}.

=> Example Script;
# Integer
age = 25
# Float
height = 1.75
# String
name = "Alice"
# Boolean
is_student = True
# List
grades = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
# Dictionary
person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
# Printing variables and their types
print(f"Name: {name}, Type: {type(name)}")
print(f"Age: {age}, Type: {type(age)}")
print(f"Height: {height}, Type: {type(height)}")
print(f"Is Student: {is_student}, Type: {type(is_student)}")
print(f"Grades: {grades}, Type: {type(grades)}")
print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}, Type: {type(coordinates)}")
print(f"Person: {person}, Type: {type(person)}")


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Conditional statements and loops allow developers to control the flow of execution based on conditions and iterate over sequences of data.
a. Example of an if-else statement
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

b. Example of a for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. They allow you to break down a program into smaller, modular components, making your code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain. Functions can take input arguments, perform computations, and optionally return results.
Functions are Useful Because of The Following Reasons:
a. Modularity - Functions help break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, improving code organization and readability.
b. Reusability - Once defined, functions can be reused multiple times in your program without rewriting the same code, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
c. Abstraction - Functions abstract away implementation details, allowing you to focus on how to use them rather than how they work internally.
Example of a Python Function and How to Call This Function:
def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    """Function to sum two numbers."""
    return a + b
result = sum_two_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
a. Lists are ordered collection while dictonaries are unordered.
b. Lists access elements by index while dictonaries access elements by key.
c. Lists are created with square brackets and dictonaries are created with curly braces.
 Example of a script;
 numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
person = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}
print("List of Numbers:", numbers)
print("Dictionary:", person)
print("\nAccessing Elements:")
print("First number in the list:", numbers[0])
print("Age of the person:", person['age'])
print("\nModifying Elements:")
numbers[0] = 10
person['city'] = 'Chicago'
print("Updated List:", numbers)
print("Updated Dictionary:", person)
print("\nAdding Elements:")
numbers.append(6)
person['gender'] = 'Female'
print("Extended List:", numbers)
print("Extended Dictionary:", person)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully manage errors that occur during program execution. It involves using try, except, and optionally finally blocks to handle potential exceptions (errors) that may arise.
Example of script;
def divide_numbers(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")
    else:
        print(f"The result of {x} divided by {y} is: {result}")
    finally:
        print("Execution of divide_numbers function completed")
# Example usage
divide_numbers(10, 2)
divide_numbers(10, 0)


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
=> Modules in Python are files containing Python code. They can define functions, classes, and variables that you can use in other Python scripts by importing them. Example - To use the math module in Python, you first need to import it into your script using the import statement.
=> Packages in Python are directories containing multiple Python modules. They help organize and structure larger Python projects by grouping related modules together. Example - You can import modules from packages using dot notation, such as import package.module.
Example Using the math Module:

import math

print("Value of pi:", math.pi)
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))
print("Factorial of 5:", math.factorial(5))

angle_rad = math.radians(90)
print("Sine of 90 degrees (in radians):"



10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
1. To read from a file in Python:
a. Open the file using the open() function.
b. Read the content using methods like read(), readline(), or readlines().
c. Close the file using the close() method or by using the file object in a with statement for automatic cleanup.
2. To write to a file in Python, you generally do the following:
a. Open the file in write or append mode using open() with 'w' or 'a' mode.
b. Write content to the file using methods like write() or writelines().
c. Close the file to save changes and free up resources.

Example of Script;
file_path = 'sample.txt'
# Open the file in read mode
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    # Read and print the entire content
    content = file.read()
    print("File Content:")
    print(content)
